## About

This project demonstrates how to create a full-stack web application using Remix, which features routing, data fetching, and rendering with a focus on performance. The app was created following the [official Remix tutorial](https://remix.run/docs), and it's intended to serve as a basic starter template for Remix-based applications.

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Remix**: A modern, full-stack web framework for building fast, resilient, and scalable web apps.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** (if applicable): A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Tailwind CSS** (if applicable): A utility-first CSS framework for designing fast, responsive websites.
- **Vercel** or **Netlify** (Optional): Platforms to deploy your app.
